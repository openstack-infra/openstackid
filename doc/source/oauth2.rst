OAuth 2.0 endpoint
==================

Using OAuth 2.0 to Access OpenStackID APIs
------------------------------------------

OpenStackID APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization. OpenStackID
supports common OAuth 2.0 scenarios such as those for web server, Service
Accounts, and client-side applications. OAuth 2.0 is a relatively simple
protocol. To begin, you register your application with OpenStackID. Then your
client application requests an access token from the OpenStackID Authorization
Server, extracts a token from the response, and sends the token to the
OpenStackID API that you want to access.


Basic steps
-----------

All applications follow a basic pattern when accessing an OpenStackID API using
OAuth 2.0. At a high level, you follow four steps:

1. Register your application.
   All applications that access an OpenStackID API must be registered through
   the OpenStackID OAUTH2 Console. The result of this registration process is
   a set of values (such as a client ID and client secret) that are known to
   both OpenStackID and your application. The set of values varies based on
   what type of application you are building. For example, a JavaScript
   application does not require a secret, but a web server application does.

2. Obtain an access token from the OpenStackID Authorization Server.
   Before your application can access private data using an OpenStackID API,
   it must obtain an access token that grants access to that API. A single
   access token can grant varying degrees of access to multiple APIs.
   A variable parameter called "scope" controls the set of resources and
   operations that an access token permits. During the access-token request,
   your application sends one or more values in the scope parameter.
   Some requests require an authentication step where the user logs in with
   their OpenStackID account. After logging in, the user is asked whether
   they are willing to grant the permissions that your application is requesting.
   This process is called user consent.
   If the user grants the permission, the OpenStackID Authorization Server
   sends your application an access token (or an authorization code that
   your application can use to obtain an access token). If the user does not
   grant the permission, the server returns an error.

3.Send the access token to an API.
  After an application obtains an access token, it sends the token to an
  OpenStackID API in an HTTP authorization header. It is possible to send tokens
  as URI query-string parameters, but we don't recommend it, because URI
  parameters can end up in log files that are not completely secure.
  Access tokens are valid only for the set of operations and resources
  described in the scope of the token request.

4.Refresh the access token (if necessary)
  Access tokens have limited lifetimes. If your application needs access to an
  OpenStackID API beyond the lifetime of a single access token, it can
  obtain a refresh token. A refresh token allows your application to obtain
  new access tokens.

Scenarios
=========


Web server applications
-----------------------

The OpenStackID OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports web server applications that use
languages and frameworks such as PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, and ASP.NET. These
applications might access an OpenStackID API while the user is present at
the application or after the user has left the application.
**This flow requires that the application can keep a secret.**

Overview
--------

The authorization sequence begins when your application redirects a browser to
the OpenStackID OAuth 2.0 Endpoint; the URL includes query parameters that
indicate the type of access being requested.The result is an authorization code,
which OpenStackID returns to your application in a query string.
After receiving the authorization code, your application can exchange the code
(along with a client ID and client secret) for an access token and, in some
cases, a refresh token.
The application can then use the access token to access an OpenStackID API.
If a refresh token is present in the authorization code exchange, then it can
be used to obtain new access tokens at any time. This is called
**offline access**, because the user does not have to be present at the
browser when the application obtains a new access token.

Forming the URL
---------------

The URL used when authenticating a user is
https://openstackid.org/oauth2/auth.
This endpoint is accessible over SSL, and HTTP connections are refused.
This endpoint is the target of the initial request. It handles active session
lookup, authenticating the user, and user consent. The result of requests to
this endpoint include access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes.

The set of query string parameters supported by the OpenStackID Authorization
Server for web server applications are:

Handling the response
---------------------

The response will be sent to the redirect_uri as specified in the request URL.
If the user approves the access request,
then the response contains an authorization code and the state parameter
(if included in the request). If the user does not approve the request, the
response contains an error message. All responses are returned to the
web server on the query string, as shown below:

An error response::

    https://oauth2-demo.com/code?error=access_denied&state=xyz

An authorization code response::

    https://oauth2-demo.com/code?state=xyz&code=123456

After the web server receives the authorization code, it may exchange the
authorization code for an access token and a
refresh token. This request is an HTTPS post, and includes the following
parameters:

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                     |

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

**REMARK**

It is advisable that you exclude client_id/client_secret params from query
string and use instead the Authorization Header
like this::

    Authorization: Basic Base64-Encoded(client_id:client_secret)

The actual request might look like the following::

 POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
 Host: OpenStackID.openstack.org
 Authorization: Basic Base64-Encoded(client_id:client_secret)
 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

 grant_type=authorization_code&code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
 &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb

An example successful response::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
     Cache-Control: no-store
     Pragma: no-cache

     {

       "access_token":"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
       "token_type":"Bearer",
       "expires_in":3600,
       "refresh_token":"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",

     }

Calling an OpenStackID API
--------------------------

After your application obtains an access token, you can use the token to make
calls to a OpenStackID API on behalf of a given user. To do this, include
the access token in a request to the API by including either an access_token
query parameter or an Authorization: Bearer HTTP header. When possible, it
is preferable to use the HTTP Header, since query strings tend to be visible
in server logs.

Examples

Here is a call to the same API for the authenticated user (me) using the
access_token Authorization Bearer HTTP header::


    GET /api/v1/users/me HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer 1/fFBGRNJru1FQd44AzqT3Zg
    Host: OpenStackID.openstack.org

Offline access
--------------

In some cases, your application may need to access an OpenStackID API when the
user is not present. This style of access is called offline, and web server
applications may request offline access from a user. The normal and default
style of access is called online. If your application needs offline access
to an OpenStackID API, then the request for an authorization code should
include the access_type parameter, where the value of that parameter is offline.
The first time a given user's browser is sent to this URL, they see a consent
page. If they grant access, then the response includes an authorization code
which may be redeemed for an access token and a refresh token. If this is
the first time the application has exchanged an authorization code for a user,
then the response includes an access token and a refresh token, as shown
below::

    {

    "access_token":"1/fFAGRNJru1FTz70BzhT3Zg",
    "expires_in":3600,
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "refresh_token":"1/xEoDL4iW3cxlI7yDbSRFYNG01kVKM2C-259HOF2aQbI"

    }

**IMPORTANT**:

When your application receives a refresh token, it is important to store that
refresh token for future use. If your application loses the refresh token,
it will have to re-prompt the user for consent before obtaining another
refresh token. If you need to re-prompt the user for consent, include the
approval_prompt parameter in the authorization code request, and set the
value to force.

After your application receives the refresh token, it may obtain new access
tokens at any time.
The next time your application requests an authorization code for that user,
the user will not be asked to grant consent (assuming they previously
granted access, and you are asking for the same scopes). As expected, the
response includes an authorization code which may be redeemed. However,
unlike the first time an authorization code is exchanged for a given user, a
refresh token will not be returned from the authorization code exchange.

The following is an example of such a response::

    {

        "access_token":"1/fFAGRNJru1FQd77BzhT3Zg",
        "expires_in":3600,
        "token_type":"Bearer"

    }

Using a refresh token
---------------------

As indicated in the previous section, a refresh token is obtained in offline
scenarios during the first authorization code exchange. In these cases, your
application may obtain a new access token by sending a refresh token to the
OpenStackID OAuth 2.0 Authorization server.
To obtain a new access token this way, your application performs an HTTPS POST
to https://openstackid.org/oauth2/token. The request must include
the following parameters:

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                     |
+==============================+=================================================================================================================================+
| refresh_token                | (required) The refresh token returned from the authorization code exchange.                                                     |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| grant_type                   | (required) As defined in the OAuth 2.0 specification, this field must contain a value of refresh_token.                         |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| scope                        | (optional) The requested scope MUST NOT include any scope not originally granted by the resource owner, and if omitted is       |
|                              | treated as equal to the scope originally granted by the resource owner.                                                         |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Such a request will look similar to the following::

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: OpenStackID.openstack.org
    Authorization: Basic Base64-Encoded(client_id:client_secret)
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA

As long as the user has not revoked the access granted to your application, the
response includes a new access token.
A response from such a request is shown below::

    {

        "access_token":"1/fFBGRNJru1FQd44AzqT3Zg",
        "expires_in":3600,
        "token_type":"Bearer"

    }

Revoking a token
----------------

In some cases a user may wish to revoke access given to an application.
A user can revoke access by visiting the following URL and explicitly
revoking access: https://openstackid.org/admin/grants . It is also
possible for an application to programmatically revoke the access given to
it. Programmatic revocation is important in instances where a user
unsubscribes or removes an application. In other words, part of the removal
process can include an API request to ensure the permissions granted to the
application are removed.

To programmatically revoke a token, your application makes a request to

https://openstackid.org/oauth2/token/revoke and includes the token as a
parameter and a hint


+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                     |
+==============================+=================================================================================================================================+
| token                        | (required) Token value to revoke                                                                                                |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| token_type_hint              | (optional) access_token/refresh_token Hint to allow Authorization Server to do a  more performant token search                  |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The token can be an access token or a refresh token. If the token is an access
token and it has a corresponding refresh token, the refresh token will also
be revoked.
If the revocation is successfully processed, then the status code of the
response is 200.
For error conditions, a status code 400 is returned along with an error code.

Token Introspection
-------------------

In OAuth 2.0, the contents of tokens are opaque to clients. This means that
the client does not need to know anything about the content or structure of
the token itself, if there is any. However, there is still a large amount of
metadata that may be attached to a token, such as its current validity,
approved scopes, and extra information about the authentication context in
which the token was issued.
These pieces of information are often vital to Protected Resources making
authorization decisions based on the tokens being presented. Since OAuth2
defines no direct relationship between the Authorization Server and the
Protected Resource,
only that they must have an agreement on the tokens themselves, there have been
many different approaches to bridging this gap.

OpenStackID Authorization Server implements `OAuth Token Introspection <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richer-oauth-introspection-04>`_
to fix that gap.

To programmatically get info  for a token, your application makes a request to

https://openstackid.org/oauth2/token/introspection

Such a request will look similar to the following::

    POST /oauth2/token/introspection HTTP/1.1
    Host: OpenStackID.openstack.org
    Authorization: Basic Base64-Encoded(client_id:client_secret)
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA

**IMPORTANT**

the token must belongs to clientid provided on the request, otherwise request
will fail

The TokenInfo endpoint will respond with a JSON array that describes the token
or an error.
Below is a table of the fields included in the non-error case:

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                     |

      "user_id": 123456

    }

Using OAuth 2.0 for Client-side Applications
============================================

The OpenStackID OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports JavaScript-centric applications.
These applications may access an OpenStackID API while the user is present
at the application, and this type of application cannot keep a secret.

Overview
--------

This scenario begins by redirecting a browser (full page or popup) to a
OpenStackID URL with a set of query parameters that indicate the type of
OpenStackID API access the application requires. As in other scenarios,
OpenStackID handles user authentication and consent, and the result is an
access token. OpenStackID returns the access token on the fragment of the
response, and client side script extracts the access token from the response.
The application may access an OpenStackID API after it receives the access token.

**NOTE:** Your application should always use HTTPS in this scenario.

Handling the response
---------------------

OpenStackID returns an access token to your application if the user grants your
application the permissions it requested.
The access token is returned to your application in the fragment as part of the
access_token parameter. Since a fragment is not returned to the server,
client-side script must parse the fragment and extract the value of the
access_token parameter.
Other parameters included in the response include expires_in and token_type.
These parameters describe the lifetime of the token in seconds, and the kind
of token that is being returned. If the state parameter was included in the
request, then it is also included in the response.

An example User Agent flow response is shown below::

    https://oauth2-demo.com//oauthcallback#access_token=123456&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600

Calling an OpenStackID API
--------------------------

After your application obtains an access token, you can use the token to make
calls to an OpenStackID API on behalf of a given user. To do this, include
the access token in a request to the API by including either an access_token
query parameter or an Authorization: Bearer HTTP header. When possible, it
is preferable to use the HTTP Header, since query
strings tend to be visible in server logs.

**NOTE**:

Be sure that OpenStackID Endpoint API that your application wants to access
it's been `CORS <http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/>`_ enabled


Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications
-------------------------------------------------

The OpenStackID OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server supports server-to-server
interactions. The requesting application has to prove its own identity to
gain access to an API, and an end-user doesn't have to be involved.

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials
(or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting
access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another
resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization
server.

The client makes a request to the token endpoint by adding the following
parameters:

+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                     |
+==============================+=================================================================================================================================+
| grant_type                   | (required) Value MUST be set to "client_credentials".                                                                           |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| scope                        | (required) Required Scopes                                                                                                      |
|                              |                                                                                                                                 |
+------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
transport-layer security (with extra line breaks for display purposes
only)::

    POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: https://openstackid.org/
    Authorization: Basic Base64-Encoded(client_id:client_secret)
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=client_credentials&scope=write.endpoint.api


An example successful response::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Cache-Control: no-store
